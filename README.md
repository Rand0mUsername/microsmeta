# microsmeta
- AngryMobs bot developed during an 8h long hackathon held in IOI preparation camp in Petnica Science Center (June 2015)
- [Original AngryMobs game - description in Serbian](http://people.dmi.uns.ac.rs/~marko.savic/AngryMobs/) (Additional hackathon rule: A player can't acquire new units if he has at least 8 units already)
- Hackathon teams: microsmeta (Dimitrije Erdeljan, myself) vs yolo (Dušan Živanović, Marko Stanković)
- Hackathon Arena uses TCP so bots have to use a wrapper written using [SFML C++ library](http://www.sfml-dev.org/)
